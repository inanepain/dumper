Write dumps last. Just before php terminates. Set to `false` to have dumps inserted as the occur at runtime.

TIP: This is mostly useful when running console code.

default: `true`

.config: turn off buffered output to print dumps inline
[source,php]
----
// Somewhere before using Dumper, or even after for a section of code and then turn buffer on again.
\Inane\Dumper\Dumper::$bufferOutput = false;
// some code loop probably
\Inane\Dumper\Dumper::$bufferOutput = true;
